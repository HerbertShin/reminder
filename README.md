# The Remind App 

The remind app uses Expo to create a native react app that has a styled text box and title. The idea of the app is to remind patients with dementia of specific tasks and to keep them connected with family and others. We plan to have a fully designed UI that has a button that adds a new reminder where the user can enter a time and task that notifies the user with push notifications.
